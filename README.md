I was like: "I'm not ready yet". well, okey. i had a random meeting with my gf (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakhona-ikromova-0a04091a2/). we talked to much about everything (i talked too much even tho i am introverted). then while we were walking back home, she randomly asked me: "do you pray?". i was like: "no, i don't, tbh. but i should start. my parents even mentioning this for a long time". then she: "start now, who not? just start it. you already did tons of stuff (e.g., https://github.com/abdibrokhim/wrapped24). so why not start praying rn? well, okey. do it and ping me on 1st January.". me: "umm... okey, mmmmm... hmmmmm... . let's do it". I'm Praying: "2025 Will Be EPIC!". https://imcook.in.
