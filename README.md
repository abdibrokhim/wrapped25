[^0]: Tbh my parents were talking about this for a long time. I was like: "I'm not ready yet". well, okey. i had a random meeting with my gf (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakhona-ikromova-0a04091a2/). we talked to much about everything (i talked too much even tho i am introverted). then while we were walking back home, she randomly asked me: "do you pray?". i was like: "no, i don't, tbh. but i should start. my parents even mentioning this for a long time". then she: "start now, who not? just start it. you already did tons of stuff (e.g., https://github.com/abdibrokhim/wrapped24). so why not start praying rn? well, okey. do it and ping me on 1st January.". me: "umm... okey, mmmmm... hmmmmm... . let's do it". I'm Praying: "2025 Will Be EPIC!". https://imcook.in.

[^5]: Today (3rd January) I dropped The Real Open Community $TROC token (e.g., to fund some of my projects. because i'm unemployed i have 0 income. i just make things; open source ai powered projects and tools for people.). It's a community token. Later on you can use it to buy some of my services, products, etc. Dexscreener: https://dexscreener.com/solana/9qc7vflmuub1nfjovwp9sryjruct56vnpuko8nlw7jbt.

[^7]: Because crypto bross constantly said; "you're holding too much supply, bro", "descrease your supply", "lock in", "put on vesting". I simple don't understand these all stuff. tbh, I was new in crypto world and meme tokens. Yep, before i did a project on web3 during hackathon [AlchemySDK + Web3 Hackathon](https://github.com/abdibrokhim/cw3d-AlchemySDK). But, anyway it's just one project back in May (i guess). So, i forgot most stuff. So... I got pressure. I panicked, I stressed. I don't understand what to do. I just sold some percent of tokens. Then, chart went all the way down. And i am dead, lol. Too many *noise. One guy helped me out. I bought them back. And lock them for 6 months. crazy. few posts: https://x.com/xopencommunity/status/1875727441718866067 | https://x.com/abdibrokhim/status/1876325414370746739.

[^8]: As a mentioned in [My Wrapped 2024](https://github.com/abdibrokhim/wrapped24) finally i was featured in Times Square. Here's a detailed post about it on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/abdibrokhim_i-was-featured-in-times-square-last-week-activity-7282050047280640000-Kriv. I wrote my journey. (and plus tips/ tricks)

[^9]: !grep is a search engine for code. It's a tool that allows you to search for code snippets in my repositories on GitHub. It's like grep, but not grep. lol. Post: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/abdibrokhim_justmakethings-activity-7283829957343023104-S15X | try https://notgrep.app .

[^10]: This is my first time organizing a hackathon instead of competing in one. LinkedIn post: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/abdibrokhim_hackathon-hackathonwin-careergrowth-activity-7284626699827245056-7ZKv. YouTube video [RAW]: https://youtu.be/i7K4pz-kjmk?si=XnRjG7S6ys9zmbeH. Join! https://discord.gg/nUdcd9p8Ae (discord). SignUp for Hackathon: https://chillguy.devpost.com/.

[^11]: I'm participating in the hackathon. So i decided to build a blazingly fast url shortener. this is notlong - a new kind of url shortener. it's Open Source. Built With: Rust, Actix, Diesel, Shuttle, Neon, Inferno, and Typescript. Features: 1. default url shortener with random 6 digit string. Roadmap: 1. .... well okey, it's here: https://github.com/abdibrokhim/notlon... . Put a star ‚≠êÔ∏è : https://github.com/abdibrokhim/notlong. Live Demo: https://youtu.be/ahZV6aAdnVI?si=V04EPf2fFxIkChBy. How to use it: https://youtu.be/laS4aLrdjDE?si=lGajeZM4Yw0r4u9Z.

[^12]: After I announced the Open Source AI Hackathon, I got a lot of messages over email and LinkedIn. I was so surprised to see that top/ senior software/ ml/ startup engineers, and etc. are really interested to be a judge. Few of them reached out me directly to help me out with organizing the hackathon ( e.g., even more properly setting up the hackathon page, discord community server, etc.). It's cool tbh, for someone ( fe: me ) who doesn't work anywhere, but "just make things" (https://imcook.in). I would like to thank Vladislav Shakhrai - ML Tech Lead at Snap Inc. with 6+ years of AI/ML experience, launching products reaching over 100M+ engagements. ( LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/shakhrayv/ ) for deep dive into the hackathon and helping me our with everything. ( ps: I know you are struggling... to find an idea and build it. Then check this post - https://www.linkedin.com/posts/abdibrokhim_i-know-you-are-struggling-to-find-an-idea-activity-7285736275242864644-ehpY ).

[^13]: tbh. it's totally insane that US President Trump just launched meme coin $TRUMP. I was like: "what the heck is going on?". My bad i knew it so, so late. And i missed the opportunity to buy some. i went to sleep in the morning around 7am. unfortunately they launched 7:44am. that hurts! nooooooo. it's crazy. totally crazy. shitt. in 16h 39m after launch it worth $30.66B in Mkt Cap. it's..... they just killed meme coin market. twit: https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1880446012168249386 .

[^14]: We officially kicked off the hackathon. that's cool. over 283+ registered participants. over 33+ applied judges. (we took only 12). over $4,5K in monetary prizes. LinkedIn post: Kick Off Stream. Wrapped Up‚Ä¶: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7288610740263919616.

[^16]: Finally... Winner Announcemen! It was so cool to organize a hackathon. Great experience. same energy or even more than participating in the hackathon. i love it tbh. i beleive we will make another soon. post: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/opencommunity_hack-the-future-ai-open-source-hackathon-activity-7292181233990541312-SueX.
it's challanging, lol. just sent all the winners and participants their certificates. at least 1 certificate for completion. and at most 3 certificates for completion, + best app winners, + podium winners. it's cool!!

[^17]: Last weekend, on 3rd February i went to Chimyon. 
I have never been in such a places before tbh. 
I had no idea what how it looks like. lol. 
I went there with my mates from Huawei Seeds for the future program. And also called my ~~gf~~ friend.
We went there by van. It was so cool,fun, and super interesting.
Best moments:
- if you are planning to go there. go early morning. and try first to play with balloons. it's super crazy!!
- i tried skiing. it lookd kinda dangerous. cause you may fall down and break your leg or whatever. but it looks kinda COOL also. LMAO. I fall down a lot and a lot. But it was super fun. it's snowyyyy. at the end i really enjoyed it. I love it. my fav sport skiing now! LMFAO.
